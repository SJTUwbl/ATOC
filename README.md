Code for [*Learning Attentional Communication for Multi-Agent Cooperation*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07733) (Jiechuan Jiang, Zongqing Lu, NIPS 2018)

## Requirements
* Python 3.6.8
* My [fork](https://github.com/shariqiqbal2810/multiagent-particle-envs) of Multi-agent Particle Environments
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/), version: 1.6.0
* [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym), version: 0.9.4

The versions are just what I used and not necessarily strict requirements.

## How to Run

All training code is contained within `train.py`. To view options simply run:

```shell
python train.py --help
```
It is not the official source code, and it has not been tested yet. I need some help to improve it.
